1. What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's not a programming language but a "markup" language, meaning it uses tags to define the elements and content of a web page. Your web browser reads this code and renders it into the visual page you see.

2. Your First HTML Document
Every HTML file starts with a basic structure. Open a text editor (like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or even Notepad) and type this code:

HTML

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is my very first webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
Save this file as index.html. Then, open it in your web browser. You should see a large "Hello, World!" heading and a paragraph below it.

Let's break down this code:

<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.

<html lang="en">: This is the root element that wraps all the content on the page. The lang="en" attribute specifies that the page's language is English, which is good for accessibility.

<head>: This section contains metadata about the page, which isn't visible on the page itself.

<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding for the document.

<title>My First Webpage</title>: The text here appears in the browser tab.

<body>: This is where all the visible content of your webpage goes. Everything you see on the screen—text, images, links—is placed inside the <body>.

<h1>: A heading tag. h1 is the most important heading. HTML has headings from h1 to h6.

<p>: A paragraph tag for regular text.

3. Common HTML Tags to Know
Here are some other essential tags you'll use frequently:

<a> (Anchor): Creates a hyperlink to another page or a different part of the same page.

HTML

<a href="https://www.google.com">Go to Google</a>
The href attribute specifies the destination URL.

<img> (Image): Embeds an image.

HTML

<img src="path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="A descriptive text for the image">
The src attribute points to the image file, and the alt attribute provides a description for screen readers and in case the image fails to load.

<ul> and <ol> (Unordered and Ordered Lists):

HTML

<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>First step</li>
  <li>Second step</li>
</ol>
<li> tags are used for each list item.

4. Your Task for Today
For your day one task, build a simple HTML page:

Create a new HTML file named about.html.

Inside the <body>, add a main heading with your name (<h1>).

Write a few paragraphs about yourself using the <p> tag.

Add an image of something you like. If you don't have an image, you can find a placeholder online.

Create an unordered list (<ul>) of your hobbies.

Add a link at the bottom of the page that says "Learn more about me" and links to your about.html file (using <a href="about.html">).
